This project implements the `Recruitdb` class in C++, which manages a collection of recruit data stored in a `vector`. The focus of the project is on efficient file handling, with methods to open, read, and close a text file that contains player information.

The primary functionality revolves around providing search methods that allow users to query player attributes such as position, height, weight, and ranking. The system is designed to efficiently retrieve and display relevant player data based on user input.

By leveraging object-oriented programming and file operations, this project enables quick and accurate searches through large datasets of player information, ensuring that the correct details are returned when specific attributes are requested.
