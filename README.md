This project involves two main classes in C++: `Recruit` and `Recruitdb`. These classes are designed to manage a collection of `Recruit` objects stored in a `std::vector`. The program includes methods to efficiently handle file operations, such as opening, reading, and closing a text file containing player data.

The primary functionality of this project is to provide efficient search methods that allow users to query specific player attributes (e.g., position, height, weight, and ranking). The goal is to create a system that quickly locates and outputs the relevant player information based on user-defined search criteria.

By leveraging object-oriented design, the project streamlines the process of searching through large datasets, ensuring accurate and fast retrieval of recruit data.
